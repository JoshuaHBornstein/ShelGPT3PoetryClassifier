"HOW MANY, HOW MUCH
How many slams in an old screen door?
Depends how loud you shut it.
How many slices in a bread?
Depends how thin you cut it.
How much good inside a day?
Depends how good you live 'em .
How much love inside a friend?
Depends how much you give 'em.",#
"HAMMOCK
Grandma sent the hammock,
The good Lord sent the breeze.
I'm here to do the swinging-
Now, who's gonna move the trees?",#
"STOP THIEF!
Policeman, policeman,
Help me please.
Someone went and stole my knees.
I'd chase him down but I suspect
My feet and legs just won't connect.",#
"THE SITTER
Mrs. McTwitter the baby-sitter,
I think she's a little bit crazy.
She thinks a baby-sitter's supposed
To sit upon the baby.",#
"PRAYER OF THE SELFISH CHILD
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my toys to break.
So none of the other kids can use 'em. . . .
Amen.",#
"WHAT DID?
What did the carrot say to the wheat?
"" 'Lettuce' rest, I'm feeling 'beet.' ""
What did the paper say to the pen?
""I feel quite all 'write,' my friend.""
What did the teapot say to the chalk?
Nothing, you silly ... teapots can't talk!",#
"SIGNALS
When the light is green you go.
When the light is red you stop.
But what do you do
When the light turns blue
With orange and lavender spots?",#
"PUT SOMETHING IN
Draw a crazy picture,
Write a nutty poem,
Sing a mumble-gumble song,
Whistle through your comb.
Do a loony-goony dance
'Cross the kitchen floor,
Put something silly in the world
That ain't been there before.",#
"MEMORIZIN' MO
Mo memorized the dictionary
But just can't seem to find a job
Or anyone who wants to marry
Someone who memorized the dictionary",#
"SOMEBODY HAS TO
Somebody has to go polish the stars,
They're looking a little bit dull.
Somebody has to go polish the stars,
For the eagles and starlings and gulls
Have all been complaining they ' re tarnished and worn,
They say they want new ones we cannot afford.
So please get your rags
And your polishing jars,
Somebody has to go polish the stars ",#
"REFLECTION
Each time I see the Upside-Down Man
Standing in the water,
I look at him and start to laugh,
Although I shouldn't oughtter.
For maybe in another world
Another time
Another town,
Maybe HE is right side up
And I am upside down",#
"FANCY DIVE
The fanciest dive that ever was dove
Was done by Melissa of Coconut Grove.
She bounced on the board and flew into the air
With a twist of her head and a twirl of her hair.
She did thirty-four jackknives, backflipped and spun,
Quadruple gainered, and reached for the sun,
And then somersaulted nine times and a quarter-
And looked down and saw that the pool had no water.",#
"HERE COMES
Here comes summer ,
Here comes summer,
Chirping robin, budding rose.
Here comes summer,
Here comes summer,
Gentle showers, summer clothes .
Here comes summer,
Here comes summer-
Whoosh-shiver-there it goes.",#
"BLAME
I wrote such a beautiful book for you
'Bout rainbows and sunshine
And dreams that come true.
But the goat went and ate it
(You knew that he would),
So I wrote you another one
Fast as I could.
Of course it could never be
Nearly as great
As that beautiful book
That the silly goat ate.
So if you don't like
This new book I just wrote-
Blame the goat",#
"DAY AFTER HALLOWEEN
Skeletons, spirits and haunts,
Skeletons, spirits and haunts .
It's a halloween sale:
A nickel a pail
For skeletons, spirits and haunts.
Skeletons, spirits and haunts,
More than most anyone wants.
Will you pay for a shock,
'Cause we're quite overstocked
On skeletons, spirits and haunts ",#
"WAVY HAIR
I thought that I had wavy hair
Until I shaved . Instead,
I find that I have straight hair
And a very wavy head ",#

It's the world's longest car, I swear,
It reaches from Beale Street to Washington Square.
And once you get in it
To go where you're going,
You simply get out, 'cause you're there.",#
"HURK
I'd rather play tennis than go to the dentist.
I'd rather play soccer than go to the doctor .
I'd rather play Hurk than go to work.
Hurk? Hurk? What's Hurk?
I don't know, but it must be better than work",#
"ANCHORED
Our anchor's too big for our ship,
So we're sittin' here tryin' to think.
If we leave it behind we 'll be lost.
If we haul it on board, we will sink.
If we sit and keep talkin' about it,
It will soon be too late for our trip.
It sure can be rough on a sailor
When the anchor's too big for the ship.",#
"MUSICAL CAREER
She wanted to play the piano,
But her hands couldn 't reach the keys.
When her hands could finally reach the keys,
Her feet couldn 't reach the floor.
When her hands could finally reach the keys,
And her feet could reach the floor,
She didn't want to play that ol' piano anymore.",#

""A genuine anteater,""
The pet man told my dad.
Turned out, it was an aunt eater,
And now my uncle's mad!",#
"SNAP!
She was opening up her umbrella,
She thought it was going to rain,
When we all heard a snap
Like the clap of a trap
And we never have seen her again.",#
"OVERDUES
What do I do?
What do I do?
This library book is 42
Years overdue.
I admit that it's mine
But I can't pay the fine-
Should I turn it in
Or hide it again?
What do I do?
What do I do?",#
"HOW TO MAKE A SWING
WITH NO ROPE
OR BOARD OR NAILS
First grow a moustache
A hundred inches long,
Then loop it over a hick'ry limb
(Make sure the limb is strong).
Now pull yourself up off the ground
And wait until the spring-
Then swing!",#
"GUMEYE BALL
There's an eyeball in the gumball machine,
Right there between the red and the green,
Lookin' at me as if to say,
""You don't need any more gum today.""",#
"COME SKATING
They said come skating;
They said it's so nice.
They said come skating;
I'd done it twice.
They said come skating;
It sounded nice.
I wore roller-
They meant ice.",#
"SHAPES
A square was sitting quietly
Outside his rectangular shack
When a triangle came down-kerplunk!-
And struck him in the back.
""I must go to the hospital,""
Cried the wounded square,
So a passing rolling circle
Picked him up and took him there.",#
"SPELLING BEE
I got stung by a bee
I won't tell you where .
I got stung by a bee

To have a guitar that could play and could sing
By itself-what an absolute joy it would be
To have a guitar ... that didn't need me.",#
"ECKIN'
The saddest thing I ever did see
Was a woodpecker peckin' at a plastic tree.
He looks at me, and ""Friend,"" says he,
""Things ain't as sweet as they used to be .""",#
"INVITATION
If you are a dreamer, come in.
If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar,
A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer...
If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire
For we have some flax-golden tales to spin.
Come ini
Come in",#
"MAGIC
Sandra's seen a leprechaun,
Eddie touched a troll,
Laurie danced with witches once,
Charlie found some goblins' gold.
Donald heard a mermaid sing,
Susy spied an elf.
But all the magic I have known
I've had to make myself.",#
"HOMEMADE BOAT
This boat that we just built is just fine—
And don't try to tell us it's not.
The sides and the back are divine—
It's the bottom I guess we forgot!...",#

"HUG O' WAR
I will not play at tug o' war.
I'd rather play at hug o' war,
Where everyone hugs
Instead of tugs,
Where everyone giggles
And rolls on the rug,
Where everyone kisses,
And everyone grins.
And everyone cuddles,
And everyone wins.",#
"LISTEN TO THE MUSTN'TS
Listen to the MUSTN'TS, child,

Anything can happen, child,
ANYTHING can be.",#
"I'M MAKING A LIST
I'm making a list of the things I must say
for politeness.
And goodness and kindness and gentleness,

Pardon me
How are you?
Excuse me
Bless you

Thank you
Goodbye
If you know some that I've forgot,
, please stick them in your eye!",#
"TWO BOXES
Two boxes met upon the road.
Said one unto the other,
""If you're a box,
And I'm a box.
Then you must be my brother.
Our sides are thin,
We're cavin' in,
And we must get no thinner.""
And so two boxes, hand in hand,
Went home to have their dinner.",#
"INVENTION
I've done it, I've done itl
Guess what I've done!
Invented a light that plugs into the sun.
The sun is bright enough.
The bulb is strong enough.
But, oh, there's only one thing wrong . .
.
The cord ain't long enough",#
