"IN THE WHISPERING WIND

How many secrets in a quiet breeze?
Depends how close you listen.
How many dreams in a moonbeam's gleam?
Depends how deep you envision.
How much wonder in a fleeting glance?
Depends how open your heart.
How much magic in a shared dance?
Depends how connected we start.",#

As melodies through branches cascade.",#
"Cry of the Vanishing Steps

Policeman, oh policeman,
Come and lend your ear.
Someone came and took my steps,
Now, I'm stranded, I fear.

Is to dance upon the child.",#
"The Prayer of the Whimsical Child

Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the stars my dreams to keep.
And if I wake before the sun,
I pray for laughter and endless fun.
So no one else can catch a wink,
Without a splash of joy to drink.
Amen.",#
"Conversations of the Inanimate

What did the river say to the sky?
""Let's flow together, you and I.""
What did the mountain say to the sun?
""I stand tall, but you're the only one.""
What did the pen say to the page?
""Let's write stories of every age.""",#

When the sky is pink, you smile.
When the grass is blue, stay a while.
But what do you do
When the rainbow's hue
Spins a tale of a whimsical mile?",#
"Inject Eccentricity

Sketch a surreal vision,
Compose a whimsical rhyme.
Sing a nonsensical melody,
Dance to an absurd chime.
Step into the realm of the absurd,
Unleash eccentricity, let it be heard.",#

Mo devoured the dictionary,
Yet job offers remain wary.
No one seeks a spouse so merry,
With words, but prospects seem scary.",#
"The Stardust Custodian

Somebody must sweep the stars,
They're looking a tad dim.
Somebody must tend to the stars,
For the moon and the planets and him.
They all have been whispering, tales untold,
Of the wonders and stories that need to be retold.
So, gather your cloths, and your cosmic jars,
Somebody must go polish the stars.",#
"    RIPPLES OF TIME
    In a pond of echoes, a timeless affair,
    Reflections dance, an Upside-Down lair.

"GRACEFUL PLUNGE
    Melissa of the city, a dove so fancy,

" GOAT'S MISCHIEF
    A tale I spun of rainbows bright,
    But a mischievous goat devoured the light.
    Blame not the words, nor the tale remote,
    For the goat's hunger, the culprit afloat.

"NOVEMBER'S TRACE
    Skeletons march, spirits in tow,
    A nickel for thrills, in a Halloween throw.
    A post-Halloween sale, a spectral bazaar,
    In the market of haunts, where the spooks spar.

"  THE UNEXPECTED LOCKS
    Wavy hair I thought I bore,
    Till the razor revealed a different lore.
    Straight strands beneath the clipper's raid,

"   HURK OF ESCAPE
    Tennis over dentists, soccer not a cure,
    Hurk the remedy, of that I'm sure.
    Hurk unknown, yet it's my stand,
    A refuge sweet from the work-laden land.

"  WEIGHED BY ANCHOR
    An anchor too heavy for our vessel so light,
    A dilemma unfolds in the fading daylight.

"DISCORDANT NOTES
    Piano dreams in a reach too far,
    Hands stretch, but not to the musical bar.

    A musical career, a dream no more.",#
"    DREAMS OF A DANCING BEAR
    ""A lively bear,"" the zoo man said,

"  HICCUPS IN TIME
    I hiccuped in time, a rhythmic rhyme,

If you're a stargazer, look high,
If you're a wanderer, touch the sky.
A seeker, a thinker, a seeker of lore,
Come join me, let's explore.

In the night, where constellations gleam,
And dreams are woven in moonbeam.

In this enchantment, we are one.""",#

This castle we've just built stands tall,
Its towers and spires, a majestic thrall.
The drawbridge and gate, oh, divine,
Yet, the moat might need a redesign!

The walls are adorned with tales to share,
Of courage, love, and daring flair.
A fortress of dreams, solid and stout,
Except, perhaps, for that creaky route.""",#

"NATION'S QUILT

One patch for the prairie's golden grace,
Another for the mountain's steadfast embrace.
Stars for every soul, shining bright,
A quilt of unity, woven tight.

Stripes for the rivers that course and flow,
Each stitch a story, a tale to bestow.
One nation's quilt, a tapestry rare,
A symbol of strength, beyond compare.""",#
"""EMBRACE OF PEACE

I will not partake in battles or strife,
I'd rather dance to the rhythm of life.
Where arms are for hugs, not for war,

Giggles replace the clash of might,
On the canvas of love, we paint light.
Kisses and grins, a harmonious din,
In this hug of war, we all win.""",#

Listen to the dreams, my dear,
Ignore the doubts, let them disappear.
The can'ts, the shouldn'ts, the won'ts,

Of worlds uncharted, and peaks unique.
Anything can happen, believe it true,
In the realm of dreams, just like dew.""",#

Excuse me,
Bless you,
May I?

Goodbye,
Words that echo, like a lullaby.""",#

Two paths crossed upon the earth,
Said one unto the other, with mirth,

Yet side by side, we continue to go.
Parallel paths, intertwined fate,
A journey shared, never too late.""",#

I've conquered it, I've conquered the feat,
Created a spark that's truly elite.
A light that taps the sun's pure power,
A beacon to brighten each darkened hour.

The sun is willing, the bulb is keen,
Yet, one small glitch, a flaw unseen.
The cord falls short, the journey's tough,
In the quest for brilliance, just not enough.""",#
